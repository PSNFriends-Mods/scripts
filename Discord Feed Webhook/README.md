# Discord Feed Webhook

### What is this about?
This is a service that automatically detects and automatically uploads all your (new) posts in a Subreddit to a Discord Channel, using *IFTTT's webhook service.*

### Can I use this Webhook elsewhere too?
Sure, no problem. But please note that you'll need the following in order for it to work:
- An IFTTT & Reddit Account
- A Discord Webhook
In addition to that, there are some customized elements, such as colors and icons matching the subreddit. You will need to change those if you intend to have a good looking webhook.

### How do I use this webhook?
Using this webhook is pretty easy, it's the way you'd use any IFTTT webhook. If you know how to do that, it should be farily easy to get your webhook running.

### Can I contribute to the look of the embed, text, etc?
Of course, yes. You can contribute to anything. Just be sure to make an [Issue](https://github.com/r-PSNFriends-Mods/user-scripts/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/r-PSNFriends-Mods/user-scripts/pulls)
